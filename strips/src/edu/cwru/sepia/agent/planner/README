We implemented CompoundGatherGold and CompoundGatherWood in addition to the base moves specified in the assignment.
Each of these applies a move to the resource, followed by a gather of that resource, a move back to the town hall, and a deposit of that resource.
This remains optimal because each full collection of a resource will require at least these moves.
By using these in the A* search we greatly reduce the branching factor and reduce the depth of the search space by 4, greatly improving the speed of the search.
